Cyber Security | Scripting | Threat hunting
Hi guys, 
I have been working in Cyber Security as a anaylyst since graduate. I have spent quite a few time on learning using Splunk such as installing new Splunk Add-on apps, configuring data input from various resources, 
fine tuning Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and threat hunting with various techniques. 
In this blog, I will share some knowledge that I have learned when stumbling through different projects. 
Hope it can a little helpful for you!
